# Research Summary - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
Completed initial research phase by analyzing the reference `top-builds` project and ESO Logs API documentation.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. API Access ✅
- **Library**: `esologs-python` from https://github.com/knowlen/esologs-python
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials (handled automatically by library)
- **API Type**: GraphQL at `https://www.esologs.com/api/v2/client`
- **Credentials**: Already configured in `.env`

### 2. Reference Project Analysis ✅
Found fully working implementation at `~/2025-development/eso/top-builds/` with:
- Complete API query examples (`api_queries.py`)
- Subclass detection algorithm (`subclass_analyzer.py`)
- Web scraping for ability bars (`web_scraper.py`, `playwright_encounter_scraper.py`)
- Gear/set analysis with LibSets integration
- Report generation and formatting

### 3. Trial List ✅
Identified 13 ESO trials to scan:

**Base Game:**
1. Aetherian Archive (AA)
2. Hel Ra Citadel (HRC)
3. Sanctum Ophidia (SO)

**DLC Trials:**
4. Maw of Lorkhaj (MoL)
5. Halls of Fabrication (HoF)
6. Asylum Sanctorium (AS)
7. Cloudrest (CR)
8. Sunspire (SS)
9. Kyne's Aegis (KA)
10. Rockgrove (RG)
11. Dreadsail Reef (DSR)
12. Sanity's Edge (SE)
13. Lucent Citadel (LC)

### 4. Data Extraction Process ✅
Mapped out complete workflow:
1. Query `worldData.zones` to get zone IDs for trials
2. For each trial, query `characterRankings` to get top 5 logs
3. Fetch each report by code with `reportData.report(code: $code)`
4. Get table data for DPS/damage breakdown
5. Scrape ability bars from web pages (not in API)
6. Extract gear from player equipment data
7. Identify buffs (Mundus, CP) from buff table
8. Analyze subclasses from slotted abilities

### 5. Subclass Detection Algorithm ✅
Located in `top-builds/src/eso_builds/subclass_analyzer.py`:
- Comprehensive mapping of abilities to skill lines
- Counts frequency of abilities from each skill line
- Returns top 3 skill lines as player's subclasses
- Uses abbreviations (Ass=Assassination, Dawn=Dawn's Wrath, Herald=Herald of the Tome, etc.)
- Example: "Ass/Herald/Ardent" = Assassination/Herald of the Tome/Ardent Fire

### 6. Set/Gear Counting Rules ✅
- 2-handed weapons and staves = 2 pieces
- Arena weapons tracked by bar (front or back)
- Monster sets = 2 pieces
- LibSets database provides dynamic set requirements
- Mythic items have special handling

## Answered Questions (11/30+)

### Fully Answered:
1. ✅ API endpoint structure
2. ✅ Public logs filtering (default in rankings)
3. ✅ Authentication method
4. ✅ List of trials
5. ✅ Data format for abilities/gear
6. ✅ Subclass detection algorithm
7. ✅ 2H weapon piece counting
8. ✅ Arena weapon handling
9. ✅ Set requirements source (LibSets)
10. ✅ API library to use (esologs-python)
11. ✅ Reference project location

### Partially Answered:
- Rate limiting (need to test in practice)
- Game update version detection (need to explore API)
- Blue CP identification (likely in buff data)

### Still Open:
- UESP URL generation for abilities
- Ability icon sources and licensing
- Hosting cost comparisons (AWS vs Cloudflare)
- Build state storage method
- Domain name selection
- Various infrastructure decisions

## Next Steps - Ready to Implement

### Phase 1: Prototype Development (Current Focus)

#### Task 1.1: Project Setup (Next)
- [x] Create virtual environment
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Install dependencies
- [ ] Verify API credentials work

#### Task 1.2: API Testing
- [ ] Test authentication
- [ ] Query available zones (get trial IDs)
- [ ] Fetch top 5 logs for one trial
- [ ] Parse report data
- [ ] Extract player information

#### Task 1.3: Port Subclass Detection
- [ ] Copy/adapt `subclass_analyzer.py` from top-builds
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify abbreviations work correctly

#### Task 1.4: Build Analysis
- [ ] Implement gear/set counting logic
- [ ] Create build "slug" generator
- [ ] Identify common builds (5+ occurrences)
- [ ] Select highest DPS per build

## Files Created
- `docs/api_research.md` - Detailed API documentation
- `docs/open_questions.md` - Updated with answers
- `docs/research_summary.md` - This file

## Time Spent
- ~1 hour on research and documentation

## Confidence Level
**High** - We have a working reference implementation to learn from, API credentials, and clear understanding of the data flow. Ready to proceed with implementation.
